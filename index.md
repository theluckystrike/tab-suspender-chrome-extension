# Tab Suspender Pro

**Looking for a safe, open source tab suspender after The Great Suspender was removed?** Tab Suspender Pro saves memory by automatically suspending inactive tabs -- so Chrome stays fast, even with dozens of tabs open.

Tab Suspender Pro is 100% free, open source, and built with your privacy in mind. No tracking, no analytics, no data collection. Just a fast, reliable tab management tool.

## Why Tab Suspender Pro?

Chrome is known for consuming large amounts of memory, especially when many tabs are open. Each tab can use 50-300 MB of RAM. Tab Suspender Pro solves this by automatically suspending tabs you are not actively using, freeing that memory for the tabs and applications you actually need.

Unlike The Great Suspender -- which was removed from the Chrome Web Store over security concerns -- Tab Suspender Pro is fully open source. You can inspect every line of code to verify it does exactly what it says: suspend tabs and save memory. Nothing else.

## A Safe Great Suspender Alternative

When The Great Suspender was pulled from the Chrome Web Store in early 2021 due to malware concerns, millions of users were left without a trusted tab suspension tool. Tab Suspender Pro was built to fill that gap with a focus on transparency and trust.

Every release is built from the public source code. There is no obfuscated code, no remote scripts, and no third-party dependencies that could compromise your browsing data.

## How It Works

1. **Install** the extension from the Chrome Web Store
2. **Browse normally** -- Tab Suspender works in the background
3. **Inactive tabs are suspended** after your chosen time period (default: 30 minutes)
4. **Click to restore** any suspended tab instantly
5. **Check your savings** on the memory dashboard

## Privacy and Security

Tab Suspender Pro operates entirely within your browser. It does not:

- Collect or transmit any personal data
- Track your browsing history
- Connect to any external servers
- Require any special permissions beyond what is needed for tab management

The full source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/theluckystrike/tab-suspender-chrome-extension) for anyone to review.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is Tab Suspender Pro really free?
Yes. Tab Suspender Pro is completely free and open source under the MIT license. There are no premium tiers, no ads, and no in-app purchases.

### Will I lose my tabs if they are suspended?
No. Suspended tabs remain in your tab bar and can be restored instantly by clicking on them. Your browsing session is preserved.

### How much memory does Tab Suspender Pro actually save?
It depends on how many tabs you have open. Users with 20-50 open tabs typically save 1-3 GB of RAM. The built-in dashboard shows your real-time savings.

### Can I prevent certain tabs from being suspended?
Absolutely. You can whitelist specific domains, pin tabs to prevent suspension, or configure the extension to skip tabs with active audio, video, or unsaved form data.

### How is this different from Chrome's built-in memory saver?
Chrome's built-in tab discarding is basic and lacks customization. Tab Suspender Pro gives you fine-grained control over which tabs get suspended, when, and provides visibility into your memory savings.
